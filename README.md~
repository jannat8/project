there is a server and 2 clients.
server will bind t
he socket and client will connect it using host and port. port should be same in client and server so they can connect together.
server will accept the request of first client and wait for second. we have a global array as conn=[] , it will deal with both the clients, we have recieve and send to recieve data from client or server or send data to client or server.
after accepting request thread will be created . cclient will send the request to server and then server will send t to other cliennt and so on..# project
